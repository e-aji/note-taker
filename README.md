# Note Taker 

## Description 

The aim of this project is to create a note taker application that can be used to write and save notes. Express.js will be used on the back end and the note data will be written and retrieved from a JSON file. Both the back and front end of the application is then connected and merged using routes and launched for deployment in Render.
